      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Shimla, also known as Simla, is the capital and the largest
      city of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It gets its name from
      Shyamala Mata, an incarnation of the goddess Kali. A temple, dedicated to
      the goddess and named Kali Bari temple, is situated near the Ridge. The
      town is located at 2,276 meters (7,467 ft) and is fondly called the "queen
      of the hills". Before independence, it served as the summer capital of
      British India. After independence, it became the capital of Punjab and
      then finally the capital of Himachal Pradesh after the state came into
      existence.
