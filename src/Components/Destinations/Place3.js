              The quaint and quiet hill station of Ooty in Tamil Nadu is one of
              the most popular mountain destinations in South India.
              Traditionally called Udhagamandalam or Ootacamund, abbreviated as
              Udhagai, Ooty is the headquarters of the Nilgiris district, with
              Doddabetta as the highest point. It is located 86 km from
              Coimbatore and 128 km from Mysore.

              The town of Ooty is tucked into the heart of the Nilgiris, making
              it a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Owing to its perfect
              geographical location on the hills, it has remained an all-time
              favorite retreat for travelers of all kinds, from the colonial
              days to the current times. The lush landscape with tea estates,
              valleys, and forested lands on one hand and the classic vibes of
              the good old days make this hill station the perfect place to
              escape. The expansive greenery, the pleasant weather, and the
              endless adventure options are what Ooty is famous for.
