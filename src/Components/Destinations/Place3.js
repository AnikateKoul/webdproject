              The quaint and quiet hill station of Ooty in Tamil Nadu is one of
              the most popular mountain destinations in South India. Ooty is the
              headquarters of the Nilgiris district, with Doddabetta as the
              highest point. The town of Ooty is tucked into the heart of the
              Nilgiris, making it a part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The
              lush landscape with tea estates, valleys, and forested lands on
              one hand and the classic vibes of the good old days make this hill
              station the perfect place to escape. The expansive greenery, the
              pleasant weather, and the endless adventure options are what Ooty
              is famous for.

              If you are looking for an offbeat place to visit in Ooty then you
              should surely check out the Tea Park. The Tea park is not known to
              many tourists. Yet it will provide you with a great experience.
              Once here you should definitely opt for the Ooty train ride.The
              best time to visit Ooty is in the summer season. The temperature
              is near 25-degree Celsius, however, the afternoons can be a little
              hot. However, sometimes the heat is unbearable but with the
              occasional showers, it wonâ€™t be a problem. The night here gets
              cold during the summer season. Therefore, do not forget to carry
              some extra warm clothes with you.
